Building a AI model to identify wheat heads using image analysis

## The Entire Process of Model Building

Let's take a moment to understand how we are going to design a model for the problem we have at hand. We can divide this process broadly into 4 stages. Each stage requires a certain amount of time to execute:
	1. Loading and pre-processing Data
		a. Loading
		b. EDA
		c. Preprocessing
	2. Defining Model architecture
		a. Library used
    b. Transfer learning
	3. Training the model 
    a. Sample size used 
    b. Using platform - GCP, AWS, Kaggle - GPU/TPU
	4. Estimation of performance
    a. Validation using out of box sample set 
    b. Validation using kaggle for model built on entire data
